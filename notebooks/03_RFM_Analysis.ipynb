    "# Olist E-commerce: RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author:** Zeeshan Akram <br>\n",
    "**Date:** 17 November 2025 <br>\n",
    "**Project:** Olist E-commerce Performance & Profitability Analysis\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a separate, dedicated analysis to segment customers based on their value. The `02_Analysis` notebook focused on *item-level* and *order-level* insights (like logistics). This notebook focuses on the **customer-level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to perform an **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to identify different customer cohorts. This will allow the business to move from a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to a targeted, strategic marketing plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why RFM Analysis Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM analysis is a classic marketing model that groups customers based on their transaction history. It's powerful because it's based on the simple premise that **80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers**. This analysis helps us find that 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of treating all customers equally, we can segment them and ask critical business questions:\n",
    "* Who are our \"Best Customers\" that we must retain at all costs?\n",
    "* Who are our \"At-Risk\" customers who are about to leave?\n",
    "* Who are our \"Lost Customers\" that we can try to win back?\n",
    "* Who are our \"New Customers\" that need to be nurtured?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Defining the RFM Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "RFM stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recency (R):** *How recently did the customer purchase?* A customer who bought 10 days ago is more likely to buy again than one who bought 10 months ago. (Lower recency = higher score).\n",
    "* **Frequency (F):** *How often do they purchase?* A customer who has made 5 purchases is more valuable than a customer who has made 1. (Higher frequency = higher score).\n",
    "* **Monetary (M):** *How much have they spent?* A customer who has spent `$1,000` is more valuable than one who has spent `$10`. (Higher monetary = higher score).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Methodology: The \"Snapshot Date\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate \"Recency,\" I must establish a single \"snapshot date\" to represent \"today.\" All recency calculations will be the difference between this snapshot date and the customer's last purchase date.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logic:** The most robust method is to set the snapshot date as **one day *after* the most recent purchase** in the entire dataset.\n",
    "* **Formula:** `Snapshot Date = max(order_purchase_timestamp) + 1 day`\n",
    "* **Justification:** This ensures that even the most recent customer has a Recency of at least 1 day and that all calculations are consistent."

    "* **Frequency:** Ranges from **1 (min)** to **17 (max)**. The **median** is **1**, and the **mean** is **1.03**. This confirms that the vast majority of the **96,076 customers** in the dataset have made only **one purchase**.\n",
